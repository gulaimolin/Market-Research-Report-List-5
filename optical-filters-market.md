<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Band-pass Optical Filter</li><li>High-pass Optical Filter</li><li>Low-pass Optical Filter</li><li>Band-stop Optical Filter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical filters are used to selectively transmit certain wavelengths of light while blocking others. There are four main types of optical filters - Band-pass, High-pass, Low-pass, and Band-stop. Band-pass filters allow a specific range of wavelengths to pass through, while blocking others. High-pass filters only allow wavelengths above a certain threshold to pass through, Low-pass filters only allow wavelengths below a certain threshold, and Band-stop filters block a specific range of wavelengths while allowing others to pass through.</p></p>

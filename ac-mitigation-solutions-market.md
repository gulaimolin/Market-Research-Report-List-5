<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC Mitigation Solutions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fault Shielding</li><li>Gradient Control Mats</li><li>Lumped Grounding Systems</li><li>Gradient Control Wire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AC mitigation solutions are crucial in preventing corrosion caused by stray currents on pipelines. Fault shielding involves isolating the pipeline from the AC source to reduce the impact of stray currents. Gradient control mats are used to dissipate the current and prevent concentration along the pipeline. Lumped grounding systems provide a low-resistance path for the current to flow safely into the ground. Gradient control wire helps to manage voltage gradients along the pipeline, minimizing the risk of corrosion. These solutions are essential for protecting pipeline infrastructure from damage.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Civil Aircraft Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Civil aircraft tires can be divided into two main types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires have cord plies that run radially from bead to bead, providing better flexibility and reducing heat build-up. This makes them ideal for high-speed applications. Bias tires, on the other hand, have cord plies that run diagonally across the tire, providing better durability and load-carrying capacity. Both types have their own advantages and are used based on specific requirements of the aircraft and the conditions in which they will be operating.</p></p>

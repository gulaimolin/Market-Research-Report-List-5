<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC Motor Starters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reduced Voltage AC Starters</li><li>Full Voltage AC Motor Starters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AC motor starters are devices used to control the starting and stopping of AC motors. Two main types include reduced voltage AC starters and full voltage AC motor starters. Reduced voltage AC starters gradually increase the voltage to the motor, reducing the initial torque and current spikes during start-up. Meanwhile, full voltage AC motor starters provide full voltage to the motor upon starting, which can lead to higher torque and increased stress on the motor. Both types of starters play a crucial role in ensuring the efficient operation of AC motors.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Condensate Recovery Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open</li><li>Closed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Condensate Recovery Devices are divided into two main market types: Open and Closed systems. In an Open market, the recovered condensate is released into the atmosphere, leading to energy loss and environmental concerns. On the other hand, Closed systems collect and recycle the condensate for reuse within the process, increasing overall energy efficiency and reducing water usage. Closed systems are more sustainable and cost-effective in the long run compared to open systems.</p></p>

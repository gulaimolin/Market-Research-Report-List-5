<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alnico Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sintered AlNiCo</li><li>Cast AlNiCo</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Alnico magnets are commonly available in two main types: sintered Alnico and cast Alnico. Sintered Alnico magnets are made by compacting fine Alnico powder in a press and then sintering it in a furnace. This results in magnets with high magnetic properties and tight tolerances. On the other hand, cast Alnico magnets are made by pouring a molten mixture of Alnico alloy into a mold and allowing it to cool. These magnets have slightly lower magnetic properties but can be cast into complex shapes. Both types are widely used in various industrial applications.</p></p>

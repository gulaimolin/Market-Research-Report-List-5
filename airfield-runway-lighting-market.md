<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airfield Runway Lighting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LED Lighting</li><li>Non-LED Lighting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Airfield runway lighting can be divided into two types: LED lighting and non-LED lighting. LED lighting is a modern, energy-efficient option that provides bright, long-lasting illumination for airfields. It is gaining popularity due to its cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits. Non-LED lighting, on the other hand, includes traditional options such as incandescent or fluorescent lights. While non-LED lighting may be cheaper upfront, it typically requires more maintenance and has higher energy consumption compared to LED lighting.</p></p>

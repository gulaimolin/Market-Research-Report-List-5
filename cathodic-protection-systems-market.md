<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cathodic Protection Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Galvanic</li><li>Impressed Current</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cathodic protection systems are used to prevent corrosion in metal structures and equipment. There are two main types of cathodic protection systems: galvanic and impressed current. </p><p>Galvanic cathodic protection systems use sacrificial anodes that are more reactive than the metal being protected, while impressed current systems use an external power source to drive a current through the structure to prevent corrosion. </p><p>Both systems are effective in preventing corrosion, but the choice between the two depends on factors such as the size of the structure, budget, and maintenance requirements.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Scanning System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Type</li><li>Non-Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>3D scanning systems can be categorized into two main types: contact and non-contact. Contact type systems involve physical contact between the scanner and the object being scanned, which can be useful for highly detailed and precise measurements. Non-contact type systems, on the other hand, use technologies such as laser or structured light to capture the object's surface without physical contact. This type is often faster and more suitable for large or delicate objects. Both contact and non-contact systems cater to different needs and applications within the 3D scanning market.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surfactant for EOR Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anionic Sulfonate</li><li>Anionic Carboxylate</li><li>Nonionic Surfactant</li><li>Biosurfactant</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surfactants for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) are used to improve the efficiency of oil extraction from reservoirs. Anionic Sulfonate surfactants work by reducing interfacial tension between oil and water. Anionic Carboxylate surfactants enhance oil recovery by increasing oil-wetness of rock surfaces. Nonionic surfactants improve oil displacement by reducing the oil-water interfacial tension. Biosurfactants are environmentally friendly surfactants produced from biological sources. Other types of surfactants include cationic surfactants and amphoteric surfactants, each with unique properties for EOR applications.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Surfactant for EOR Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil Sands Oil Field</li><li>Conventional Oil Field</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surfactants are widely used in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) for both oil sands and conventional oil fields. In oil sands, surfactants help reduce the viscosity of bitumen, allowing for easier extraction. In conventional oil fields, surfactants aid in displacing oil from reservoir rocks and enhancing oil recovery rates. By lowering interfacial tensions and improving the flow of fluids, surfactants play a crucial role in maximizing oil production efficiency in both types of oil fields.</p></p>

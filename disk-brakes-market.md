<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disk Brakes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Opposed Piston Type</li><li>Floating Caliper Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Disk brakes are commonly divided into two main types: Opposed Piston Type and Floating Caliper Type. Opposed Piston Type brakes have pistons on either side of the disc, providing more even pressure distribution and better braking efficiency. On the other hand, Floating Caliper Type brakes have a single piston that moves within the caliper, resulting in simpler design and lower cost. Both types have their own advantages and suitability for different vehicles and applications in the market.</p></p>

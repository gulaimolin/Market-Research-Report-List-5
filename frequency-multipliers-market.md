<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Frequency Multipliers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Frequency Multipliers</li><li>Passive Frequency Multipliers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Frequency multipliers are devices used to generate higher frequency signals from lower frequency inputs. Active frequency multipliers use active components such as transistors to amplify and multiply the input frequency. They offer higher output power and broader frequency ranges but are more complex and expensive. Passive frequency multipliers, on the other hand, use passive components like diodes to achieve frequency multiplication. They are simpler and cheaper but have lower output power and narrower frequency ranges. Both types cater to different market needs based on cost, complexity, and performance requirements.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photosensitive Polymer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Photosensitive Reversible</li><li>Photosensitive Irreversible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photosensitive polymers are categorized into two main types - photosensitive reversible and photosensitive irreversible. Photosensitive reversible polymers are materials that change their physical or chemical properties upon exposure to light, but can also revert back to their original state once the light source is removed. On the other hand, photosensitive irreversible polymers undergo a permanent change in their structure or composition upon exposure to light, resulting in a permanent alteration that cannot be reversed. These two types of photosensitive polymers offer different applications and advantages in various industries.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dedusting Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Central Dedusting System</li><li>Independent Dust Collector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Central Dedusting System refers to a dust collection system that is centralized and connected to multiple workstations or machines through a network of ducts. It is ideal for large industrial facilities where dust is generated at multiple points. On the other hand, Independent Dust Collector refers to standalone dust collection units that are installed at individual workstations or machines. They are suitable for smaller facilities or specific applications where centralized systems may not be feasible. Both types of systems aim to improve air quality and reduce health hazards associated with dust exposure in industrial settings.</p></p>

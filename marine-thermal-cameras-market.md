<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Thermal Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uncooled Type</li><li>Cooled Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Marine thermal cameras are classified into two main types: uncooled and cooled. Uncooled thermal cameras utilize a microbolometer to detect infrared radiation and do not require cooling mechanisms, making them more cost-effective and lightweight. On the other hand, cooled thermal cameras use a cooling system to enhance image quality and sensitivity, making them more suitable for long-range surveillance in challenging marine environments. Both types of thermal cameras have their own unique advantages and applications in the marine industry.</p></p>
